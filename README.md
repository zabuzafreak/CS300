1.What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Creating a set of data structures that can take input (in this case, classes and their prerequisites), store them into objects, and then presenting them to the user in a couple of different ways.

2.How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

The first part of the approach is parsing data. Without parsing and storing the data, we have nothing to display to the user. After that we create the menu with it's options. Data structures are the backbone to just about everything in software, so it's important to understand their uses and how to work with them.

3.How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

It depends on the roadblock. Some roadblocks are resolved just by trying and trying again, with each iteration bringing you closer to your intention. Others you just need the wisdom of those who have been doing it longer. There are many websites that are invaluable when it comes to figuring out how to attempt something new. The first place I stop is always going to be documentation and then if I can't figure it out from there, I'll move on to Internet forums.

4.How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

I'm interested in doing more work with binary search trees. I've seen them implemented before, but having worked with one myself, I'd like to see what I can personally accomplish with them. Other than that, working with different data structures has expanded my knowledge of how different structures operate. 

5.How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I'm gonna be honest, I don't think this part of my coding has improved substantially. I feel like this is really a skill that is only adapted once you work in a setting where you're constantly exchanging code with other team members who have to work in your code base, and you in theirs.
